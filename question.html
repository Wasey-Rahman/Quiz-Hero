    <h2>1)Show the difference of map,filter,for-each and find.</h2>
    <p>The difference of map,filter,for-each and find are given below.
        Firstly,map calls the supplied method for each member as it iterates through the array's elements in a loop. The initial array is not changed by this technique; instead, a new array is created.Then,filter creates a new array in JavaScript that contains the components that satisfy the given criteria. This procedure checks the condition specified in the supplied function and executes it for each element in the array, passing only those elements that meet the specified condition.Moreover,for-each used to run the same code on each member of an array, but it has no effect on the array itself and yields undefined.Lastly,find returns the first member of the array that meets the callback function's criteria.
